**Quran counter** is a tool for fast and easy searching in the Holy Quran (`exe` download link at the bottom).

The app's interface currently has English and Arabic translations:

Here's a breakdown of some of the various features the app provides:

As you can see there are several features in the Quran Browser window. For example:
- Number of words inside selection.
- The Surah's unique words number.
- The Surah's most repeated word.
- Exclusive phrases in the Surah (words or phrases that don't appear in other Surahs).
